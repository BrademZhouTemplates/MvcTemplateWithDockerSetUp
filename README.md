# The Braden Everson Official Template Project (yuh)
### _trapaholic_


Pretty much just my template project that I'll use for projects that I want to host on Heroku. I might make a version with user perms too if I ever get to a point where I want that but given the fact that my only server I have is a 10 year old PC from a literal dumpster being hosted at my dad's house, I don't think I'll be making heavily database dependent projects just yet ;)
